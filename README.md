## Project Overview

In this project, I built a fully functional **Coffee Sales Dashboard** that allows users to explore and analyze key sales metrics, product performance, and trends over time. This project demonstrates advanced Excel skills and provides a real-world application of data analytics techniques.

### Key Concepts & Techniques:

1. **XLOOKUP**:
   - Used to dynamically fetch and display relevant data from large datasets.
   - Replaced legacy lookup functions for efficient, accurate data retrieval.

2. **INDEX MATCH**:
   - Implemented for flexible data lookups across large datasets, offering greater control over data extraction than traditional lookup functions.
   - Combined with conditional logic to pull specific information based on user-defined criteria.

3. **Multiple IF Statements**:
   - Built complex conditional logic for data categorization, including multi-layered decision-making processes.
   - Used to calculate sales outcomes and categorize data into meaningful segments.

4. **Date and Number Formatting**:
   - Applied **Date Formatting** to clean and standardize date fields for accurate analysis.
   - Used **Number Formatting** to ensure consistency and clarity in financial and sales data.

5. **Check for Duplicates**:
   - Utilized data validation and duplicate check functions to clean and prepare data before analysis.
   - Ensured data quality and integrity, a crucial step in any data analysis project.

6. **Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts**:
   - Created **Pivot Tables** to summarize data and calculate key metrics like total sales, revenue per product, and sales by region.
   - Used **Pivot Charts** to provide interactive visualizations of trends and performance, allowing for easy data exploration.

7. **Slicers and Timelines**:
   - Added **Slicers** to provide interactive filtering options for the dashboard, enabling users to view data by product, region, or sales representative.
   - Integrated a **Timeline** to allow for dynamic filtering of data over specific time periods.

8. **Dynamic Dashboard**:
   - Built a dynamic **dashboard** to display key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total revenue, top-selling products, and sales trends.
   - Ensured the dashboard automatically updates with any changes in the underlying data.
